This world would undoubtedly be better if we were all in heaven. Should be noted, though, I'm not doing this for anyone alive in the world today. I realize people value their lives and I'm taking revenge on them for being so goddamn stupid. I would be nothing and This whole event will never occur if it weren't for Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine high school. Worked hard to achieve freedom in Heaven. I admire them greatly because they saw something wrong in the world and moved away the herd of sheep to do something about it. They also possessed three crucial things a person needs in order to become a god: #Intelligence, ideology, and malice (or cruelty). This wasn't the only example of people becoming Gods, either. Julius Caesar and Vladimir Lenin also became gods. I became a profit because they're spread the word of  god, Eric Harris. I do this because the world is better and painful. People often celebrate the good things in life, but that's only a lie. All good things must end so why celebrate? . But you don't have to live don't have to endure this harsh and evil world. The world for most people can only find happiness or enjoyment and doing drugs drinking alcohol making your fellow man suffer (not that that's bad. It's just when you preach that human should be nice to each other then are only concerned about yourself, makes you an exhibit of hypocrisy.) \n"], [u'eric harris', u'harris', 'line 8', u"\tThe only thing I wish didn't come out of this was the pain it would inevitably cause my closest friends and family.
